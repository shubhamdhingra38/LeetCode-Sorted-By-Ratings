# LeetCode Questions Sorted By Ratings
Sorts questions using like dislike ratio to filter out low rated questions.
LeetCode doesn't give any option to view questions with high like/dislike ratio, only the top 100 liked questions.

## TODO:
- [x] Return results in nicer format (HTML)
- [x] request using non blocking async calls
- [] Show question tags
- [] Filter by things (difficulty level, tags)
